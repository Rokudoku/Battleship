# Battleship
A basic Java game that is based on the Battleship board game. This was an Eclipse project so I pushed the .classpath and .project files so it can easily be imported as a project in Eclipse.

Currently runs only in the console and plays as a single player game where the player guesses until all ships are destroyed.

I decided to make this project after I learned the basics of Java as a way to practice and cement those basics.
There were also a lot of other cool tricks and important fundamentals I picked up while working on this project.

This project is currently benched as I go back to learning more about Java and/or revising Python stuff as uni is just about to start up again.
However, I might come back to this when I learn how to make interfaces/GUIs in Java.
